# functional HTTP server and client system

The goal of this project is to implement a functional HTTP server and client system. Clients and servers communicate by exchanging individual messages (as opposed to a stream of data). The messages sent by the client, usually a Web browser, are called requests, and the messages sent by the server as an answer are called responses.

Basically, HTTP is a TCP/IP based communication protocol, that is used to deliver data (HTML files, image files, query results, etc.) on the World Wide Web.
 HTTP/1.0 uses a new connection for each request/response exchange, whereas HTTP/1.1 connection may be used for one or more request/response exchanges.
